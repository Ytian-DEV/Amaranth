# AMARANTH v2 — Progress

> **Resume ("continue"):** read this file → `git status` → check out the branch in "Current branch" → finish uncommitted work → continue from the first unchecked item. Plan: `docs/v2/PLAN.md`. DB: `docs/v2/DB.md`. Figma file `jpKBeBp37twnW7eXj0Nk2S` (frames: Components 3:28, Home desktop 4:2, Home mobile 7:64, Admin dashboard 8:101).

**Current branch:** `develop` (next: create `feature/cms-editorial-workflow`)
**Last done:** `feature/cms-article-editor` merged — `/admin/articles` (search, status/section/mine filters, pagination, stacked on mobile) and editor (TipTap body with image upload + YouTube, autosave every 2.5s for drafts / revision snapshots for live articles, unsaved-changes guard, cover upload with variants, authors, tags, category, label, featured, excerpt, SEO with preview, workflow buttons via `transition_article`). Schema: invited staff get a contributor; creator auto-credited.
**Next step:** `feature/cms-editorial-workflow` — activity timeline + review notes thread on the editor (`article_activity`, `add_article_note`), review queue view (`/admin/articles?status=submitted` shortcut / “Needs review” tab), revisions list with restore, home-page curation (lead + folio slots) for publishers.

## Decisions log
- 2026-10-17 DB option **B** (fresh schema, user pastes `supabase/v2/schema.sql` then `seed.sql`).
- 2026-10-17 Pre-v2 uncommitted Dashboard/index.css saved as WIP commit on `feature/edit-article-restructure` (not merged).
- Branch order: DB first (user priority), then tooling.

## Conventions (read before building)
- v2 code: `src/app` (router, layouts), `src/components/ui` (atoms), `src/components/story` (Figma story components), `src/lib` (supabase, types, format, media), `src/dev` (fixtures + `/dev/*`, dev builds only), feature folders `src/features/<area>`.
- `src/legacy` = v1 app, mounted by the router's `*` route until every page is rebuilt; excluded from lint/typecheck. Delete in `feature/v2-polish`.
- Tokens: `src/styles/tokens.css` (`@theme static`) → utilities like `bg-paper text-ink font-serif text-headline-m text-kicker`. No hex in components (lint rule). `npm run check:contrast`.
- Types: `src/lib/database.types.ts` is hand-written; update it with any schema change.
- Gate before each feature's last commit: `npm run check` (lint, typecheck, test, build; trust its exit code) + `npm run db:test` for DB changes.
- UI checks: run `window.__domCheck()` (dev builds, `src/dev/domCheck.ts`) at 375/768/1024/1440 on the `/dev/<screen>` fixture route. Claude's preview server: `.claude/launch.json` → port 5174 (the user may have their own dev server on 3000; leave it alone).
